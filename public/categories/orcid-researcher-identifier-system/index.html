        <p>ORCID provides a persistent digital identifier for researchers that distinguishes them from other researchers and connects them with their research activities and outputs across their entire career. As a non-profit organization, ORCID addresses the name ambiguity problem in scholarly communication by providing each researcher with a unique 16-digit identifier that remains constant throughout their career.</p>
<p>The system serves as a hub that connects researchers with their professional activities, ensuring proper attribution of research outputs regardless of name changes, institutional affiliations, or career transitions.</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-orcid-different">What Makes ORCID Different</h2>
<p>ORCID&rsquo;s persistent identification approach includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unique 16-digit identifier that remains constant throughout a researcher&rsquo;s career</li>
<li>Integration with major publishers, funding agencies, and institutional systems</li>
<li>Comprehensive profile that aggregates all research activities and outputs</li>
<li>Privacy controls that allow researchers to manage the visibility of their information</li>
<li>Automated data integration from trusted sources like CrossRef and institutional repositories</li>
<li>Non-profit governance that ensures researcher interests remain the priority</li>
</ul>
<p>Researchers and academic institutions choose ORCID when they need a reliable way to ensure proper attribution of research outputs and streamline the administrative burden of maintaining accurate researcher profiles across multiple systems.</p>
<h2 id="key-features">Key Features</h2>
<p>• <strong>Persistent Identifier</strong> - Unique 16-digit ID that distinguishes researchers from others with similar names
• <strong>Research Profile</strong> - Comprehensive record of publications, grants, affiliations, and other scholarly activities
• <strong>Automated Integration</strong> - Connect with publishers, funders, and institutions for automatic profile updates
• <strong>Privacy Controls</strong> - Granular settings to control the visibility of different types of information
• <strong>Workflow Integration</strong> - Seamless integration with manuscript submission and grant application systems
• <strong>Data Portability</strong> - Export and import research information across different platforms and systems
• <strong>Verification System</strong> - Trusted sources can add and verify information in researcher profiles
• <strong>Global Standards</strong> - Interoperability with international research information systems</p>
